# NoobCogs

Some random cogs for red discord bot made by a noob at python.

These cogs are for red-discordbot with discord.py version 2 and above.

Some of the cogs are poorly coded and buggy so handle these cogs with care.

If you have any issues with any of the cogs be sure to open an issue or make a pr.
